An app created for the Springboard Software Engineering program
as my first Capstone project. This app has basic CRUD capabilities,
such as authentication, registration, and search functionality. Users
can search for a transit station at a location near them. If they click
on one of the transit stations offered to them, a list of five upcoming
departures will show, along with their placements on a map. The map
placements are not intended to be exact; rather, to show a general idea as
to where the stop is located.
